			How Iman Gadzhi Went From High School Drop Out To Making $1 Million<br> At 18 By Shaking Up The Agency & E-Learning Industry
		</div>
		<div id="intro">
			<p>Hi, my name is Iman Gadzhi and I’d like to share my life story & the birth of growyouragency.com</p>
			Before we start, there’s one thing I want you to bear in mind: I’m on a mission to reform the education system. It’s a mission that governs every decision in my life. You’re about to find out why…

			<h2>Early Days</h2>
			<p>My story starts in a little town in South Russia called Dagestanskiye Ogni.</p>
			<p>I was born there to a single mother – my father, an abusive alcoholic, left long before I was born.</p>
			<p>We lived together in post-Soviet Union poverty, and my mother – my best friend and hero – worked three jobs to take care of me – so I spent most of my time with my grandma.</p>
			<p id="bubble1"><img src="../img/Iman-Early-Days.jpg" alt=""></p>
			<p>Then…</p>
			<p>One day my mom came home and told me we were going to live in London. I didn’t understand what this meant but soon took my first ever flight and landed in Great Britain.</p>
			<p>This incredible turn of fortune came as my mother got together with my step-father – they had met in Moscow and dated for a few months, and he’d decided he wanted us to live with him in London. </p>
			<p>So in the space of just one month, everything changed for us. We went from not even having a toilet inside our house, to living in one of the most exclusive areas in the city. I ended up going to an elite private school and living a life that was unimaginable for my mother only a few months ago. </p>
			<p>Of course, if this was where the story ended, you wouldn’t be here, this website wouldn’t exist and I’d be at university right now on the same path as all my friends. </p>
			<h2>Dark Days</h2>
			<p id="bubble2">Very quickly, my idyllic childhood started to fade. My mother separated with my step-dad and we were plunged back into our old lives: he cut us off entirely. </p>
			<p>At the age of fourteen, I was faced with an awful burden: taking care of myself and my mother. </p>
			<h2>First Businesses (Failed)</h2>
			<p>Despite a childhood dream compelling me to make it as a professional footballer, I realized, aged 15, I simply wasn’t good enough. </p>
			<p>It was time to find another way to make money. </p>
			<p>So I started on Instagram. Buying and selling accounts. I made a decent amount of money for a 15-year-old too! And then, in one bad decision, managed to lose it all by investing in one account that failed dramatically. </p>
			<img src="../img/Screenshot-2019-01-06-at-08.10.23.png">
			<p>Undeterred, I set about desperately trying to find new ways to make money. I had a real love for fitness and would spend days and nights studying personal training manuals, then pestering my friends’ parents to let me train them! </p>
			<p>I made a couple of hundred pounds a month doing this and thought I was a true businessman. So I invested in myself and bought my first ever camera: a £400 Canon.</p>
			<p>I used and abused that thing, set up shoots anywhere I could find them and tried to learn a new craft. </p>
			<p>Meanwhile, I had another brainwave. I was still playing semi-pro football at this time and, knowing a bit about social media, had always told the owner of the club how poor their channels were and how I could do a better job.</p>
			<p>Eventually, the owner relented…</p>
			<p>He said – ‘Okay Iman, why don’t you manage our content & social media?’</p>
			<p>And before I could say yes, he said ‘And how much would that cost?’</p>
			<p>Huh?</p>
			<p>How much would it cost? I had absolutely ZERO idea that you could charge companies to manage their social media.</p>
			<p>So I absolutely shit myself and told him I would get back to him on that.</p>
			<p>I racked my brains, did a tiny bit of research settled on the grand sum of £75 a week. Yes… my first every agency client was £300 per month.</p>
			<img src="../img/Screenshot-2019-01-05-at-10.06.49.png" alt="">
			<p>It really didn’t matter if that first retainer was £1/pm or £300/pm. It gave me the greatest gift I could have ever gotten at the time, hope.</p>
			<p>It was the first time in my life that I had recurring income and could finally say ‘my client’ (something I still find cool to this day).</p>
			<h2>Turning Point</h2>
			<p>It was an entire seven months until I got my next client. Most people would have given up at that point… but I was hooked.</p>
			<p>I kept pressing and pressing until I finally landed a meeting with a company called Aflete.</p>
			<p>I showed up to their swanky London office and instantly felt chills down my spine. By the end of the meeting, the Founder (Shan) was asking me to send over a proposal.</p>
			<p>Now I had a bit more idea about what I could charge, and what other companies did too, so I sent over a quote for £1,900 a month, a number that I threw out with expectations of negotiation down to something like £1,000.</p>
			<p>I sent it off while I was sitting IN class at school. As I left for lunch break, I refreshed my email and Shan had written back with just two words… ‘Call me’.</p>
			<p>I remember sitting on the curb of the street outside the school, using my phone as a hotspot with my computer in front of me. Shan went through some logistical issues but finally ended with… ‘Okay, let’s do it’.</p>
			<img src="../img/maxresdefault-4.jpg" alt="">
			<p>I couldn’t believe what I was hearing…</p>
			<p>I ran inside to the lunch cafeteria and hugged my best friend. The entire hall looked at me as I was screaming & shouting in victory.</p>
			<p>This was the turning point in my agency career.</p>
			<p>The next two weeks were to be even crazier. I went on to sign my second client for £1,500 and then another for £750. Within 14 days I went from £300/pm with a horribly underpriced client (that I dropped straight after) to £4,150 per month with three clients while I was still in High School.</p>
			<p>This was the kick I needed and I knew it was time to fulfill a promise I made to myself almost 3 weeks prior.</p>
			<h2>Becoming a High School Dropout</h2>
			<p>Three weeks prior to signing Aflete, I promised myself that if I could get enough clients on a monthly retainer to cover my overheads plus rent (which I didn’t have to pay for at the time), then I would drop out of school.</p>
			<p>fter signing Aflete and the two clients all within 14 days, I had hit the number that I needed to in order to drop out. Now came the logistical nightmare of going to the council, pleading with my school and finding a way to drop out at the age of 17.</p>
			<img src="../img/Working-in-front-of-computer.jpg" alt="">
			After 2-3 weeks I had made it work and I was showing up to school for my final day ever.
			<p>I’ve never felt more anxiety and doubt in my life than when I dropped out of school.</p>
			<p>I remember walking around the Boltons in London looking at the houses filled with tears in my eyes wondering if I was about to throw away the education that my mom had sacrificed her entire life for.</p>
			<h2>Building A Real Agency</h2>
			<p>Not long after dropping out, I went on to land more clients: ZebraFuel & FuroSystems. At this point, I was beyond the six-figure threshold and I was absolutely walking on clouds.</p>
			<p>Then everything came crashing down.</p>
			<p>I started to lose clients.</p>
			<p>I had no way of proving an ROI – I was offering social media management and gleefully reporting on ‘likes’ and ‘followers’.</p>
			<p>To my clients, it seemed, there was only one way of demonstrably growing their business using social media.</p>
			<p>Paid traffic.</p>
			<p>So I spend the next six months selling Facebook ads services and failing every damn time.</p>
			<p>I tried everything I could to make it work: I bought all the courses & worked with a bunch of coaches.</p>
			<img src="../img/AJSmart-consulting.jpg" alt="">
			<p>It was only when I turned on my laptop one day, typed in ‘Expedia’ to book a surprise holiday for my mom when I saw that Expedia had made $10 Billion that year with an incredibly lean operation.</p>
			<p>As I started to read the article it became clear to me what Expedia’s business model was: connect the customer with the service and wrap it under the ‘Expedia’ experience. Expedia owned zero planes & zero hotels yet it made more profits than the businesses that did!</p>
			<p>At that moment it clicked. I didn’t actually have to deliver the Facebook ad services myself, I could get someone else to deliver it and I could focus on sales and operations. The best bit is that I would take home the majority of the profits…</p>
			<h2>The Start of My Vision</h2>
			<p>As my agency grew, and I was less than discrete with my new found wealth, a couple of people started to notice how well things were going for me: I’d been documenting my life on Instagram and YouTube for some time.</p>
			<p>And then one day, I met up with a YouTube subscriber and he asked me if I could show him how I’d built my agency.</p>
			<p>I told him of course, but he insisted on asking me ‘how much do you charge an hour?’</p>
			<p>This was brand new to me. I’d provided services to companies before, but I’d never been consulted on how to grow an agency – that seemed absurd!</p>
			<p>But I responded ‘£100’.</p>
			<p>That very same student, after only two hours of my ‘coaching’ went on to sign his first $1,500/pm client.</p>
			<p>This meant two things:</p>
			<p>I was undercharging</p>
			<p>I could grow an agency, and teach others how to do the same</p>
			<p>And boy did I…</p>
			<p>But there’s only so much time in the day you can dedicate to teaching others without forgetting how to do it yourself, so I devised a solution. A program – a simple, step-by-step formula that anyone could follow to build their agency. And so, on February 1st, 2018 after working with a test group of fifty students, I released Six Figure SMMA.</p>
			<h2>Reforming A System</h2>
			<p>Results.</p>
			<p>Suddenly, I had created something much bigger than myself.</p>
			<p>Within twelve months of the course being released, we had over 1,100 customers enrolled. </p>
			<img src="../img/MM1.jpg" alt="">
			<p>This coincided with an intense alignment of my passion & purpose. I realized that most of the problems our modern world faces can be fixed with the right education.</p>
			<p>Most people can’t operate out of abundance, they can’t contribute to the world if they’re thinking about how to pay their bills.</p>
			<p>I made a commitment to myself that I was going to use my experience and talent to build genuinely practicable online courses and revolutionize education through e-learning.</p>
			<p>What this didn’t mean is that I gave up my agency. It’s always annoyed me that some ‘gurus’ will teach, having gleefully run away from the thing they claim to be an expert in.</p>
			<p>That’s why I still run my agency – and it continues to generate  $45,000/pm+ profit.</p>
			<p>As long as I teach, I’ll be testing my course on myself before I let students take the risk.</p>
			<h2 id="bubble3">A Company & Vision</h2>
			<p>In 2019, GrowYourAgency.com was born.</p>
			<p>It was the amalgamation of the courses I had previously offered, and the new home to Agency Incubator, our flagship program.</p>
			<p>rowYourAgency.com now operates with a single mission, expanded from my own: to reform the education system by creating the best online programs the world has ever seen.</p>
			<p>But staying true to our ethos and our full circle approach, we’re going to go one step further. I have made a commitment to take 10% of our annual profits to build schools in the developing world –</p>
			<p>I’ve made a commitment to take 10% of yearly company profits & put the money straight into building schools in underdeveloped countries.
			<h2>Unfinished Business</h2>
			<p>It’s been one hell of a ride, but I’ve only just started.</p>
			<p>GrowYourAgency.com is going to explode – and there’s one person I want to grow with it.</p>
