			<h1>
				We’re On A Mission To <br>
				Reform The Education <br>
				System
			</h1>
			<p>Here’s how we envision it:</p>
		</div>
		<div id="envision-div">
			<div id="value-div">
				<h3>Value</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Our goal whenever we create a program is to make it 100x better than University for less than 1% of the price.</p>
					<p>We’re also looking to make our online programs 10x better than masterminds & courses out there that cost $50,000+</p>
					<p>We intentionally underprice our programs knowing that if we can be better AND cheaper than the rest of the market, we’ll execute our vision of reforming the education system.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="approch-div">
				<h3>Approach</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Our programs look to instill what Iman calls ‘Hawk Eye’. This is the key skill you need if you’re going to build a profitable agency.</p>
					<p>Through our programs we make sure you’ve got a hawk eye over every aspect of the business. That you understand how to run and manage an agency like a real 6 & 7-Figure agency owner.</p>
					<p>We go to extreme lengths to make sure that you have all our tools & protocols in true plug n’ play fashion. We do most of the heavy lifting for you.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div id="vision-div">
				<h3>Full Circle Vision</h3>
				<div>
					<p>We’ve made the commitment to pump 10% of company profits into building schools in underdeveloped countries.</p>
					<p>We have a ‘full circle’ vision.</p>
					<p>A vision to grow a company that instills change in both sides of the world, those that have been failed by modern education and those that never got education at all.</p>
